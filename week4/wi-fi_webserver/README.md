Wi-Fi Temperature Monitor (ESP32)

Project Description

This project implements a Wi-Fi-enabled temperature monitoring system using an ESP32 and a DHT sensor. The ESP32 hosts a web server that displays live temperature, humidity, device uptime, and provides a button to control an onboard LED. The webpage automatically refreshes every 10 seconds to display updated sensor readings.

DHT Sensor Library by Adafruit

How to Run

Open the project in Arduino IDE.

Install the required libraries.

Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and Password in the code.

Upload the sketch to the ESP32.

Open the Serial Monitor (115200 baud).

Note the IP address displayed after the ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi.

Enter the IP address into a web browser.

View the live dashboard and use the Toggle LED button to control the LED.

Expected Output

The web page displays:

Current Temperature

Current Humidity

Device Uptime

ESP32 IP Address

Toggle LED Button

Automatic Refresh every 10 seconds

Simulation Note

This project was developed using Wokwi with an ESP32 and a DHT22 sensor, as DHT11 is not available in the simulator. The DHT22 is fully compatible for demonstrating the required functionality. The web interface was designed to represent the expected output of the ESP32 web server.
